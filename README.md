## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The python files in this repo should run with Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this repo I wanted to explore about web scraping using python scripts. Web scraping is the term for using a program to download and process content from the web. For example, Google runs many web scraping programs to index web pages for its search engine. We will create a repo of example modules that we can use to scrape web pages in Python.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

WebScraper.ipny - Python notebook where we begin exploration of data. Here we will create different functions and learn to do web scraping and present our findings.
